Read [Codex runtime](../../references/codex-runtime.md) before using this skill. Apply its tool, model, permission, and history rules to the workflow below.

# Swarm

Fan out N workers within the Codex concurrency limit. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the session concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `.codex/pstack-models.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `inherit-parent`. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit `model` so the workers run on the parent model. On model rejection, use the parent-model fallback in Codex runtime and report reduced diversity.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with a general Codex worker prompt, an isolated worktree, asynchronous Codex agent calls, and the step 4 model, left unset for `auto` or `inherit-parent`. Use the current workspace only when the worker needs access to something on the user's computer.

When a worker needs a specific branch, prepare an isolated worktree at that verified ref and pass its absolute path in the prompt.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and rerun that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
